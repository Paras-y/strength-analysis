Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction using Machine Learning

Concrete is one of the most important materials in Civil Engineering. Knowing the compressive strength of concrete is very important when constructing a building or a bridge. The Compressive Strength of Concrete is a highly nonlinear function of ingredients used in making it and their characteristics. Thus, using Machine Learning to predict the Strength could be useful in generating a combination of ingredients which result in high Strength.

Description and Project Overview This project will be based on a dataset obtained from the UCI Repository. The dataset consists of 1030 observations under 9 attributes. The attributes consist of 8 quantitative inputs and 1 quantitative output

Attribute information
Inputs
•	Cement
•	Blast Furnace Slag
•	Fly Ash
•	Water
•	Superplasticizer
•	Coarse Aggregate
•	Fine Aggregate
All above features measured in kg/$m^3$
•	Age (in days)
Output
•	Concrete Compressive Strength (Mpa)

 Modelling and Evaluation
•	Algorithms used
o	Linear regression
o	Lasso regression
o	Ridge regression
o	Decision Trees
o	Random Forests
•	Metric - Since the target variable is a continuous variable, regression evaluation metric RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and R2 Score (Coefficient of Determination) have been used.
